### Core

- [x] Protocol framing (encode/decode usbmux packets)
- [x] Clean error handling
- [x] Logging + debug mode

### Device Management

- [x] Track connected devices
- [x] Handle device unplug safely
- [x] Support multiple devices at once

### Connection

- [x] Raw USB packet parser
- [x] Per-connection state (sequence numbers, etc.)
- [x] Multiplex multiple connections
- [x] Clean connection shutdown
- [ ] Timeout handling
- [x] Respect the device window size

### Runtime Models

- [x] Daemon mode (system-style long running service)
- [ ] Exclusive ownership mode (single process fully owns the USB interface)
- [ ] Shared mode (multiple clients coexist and access is multiplexed safely)
- [ ] Exclusive lock with wait queue (one owner at a time, others block until the owner releases)

### Compatibility

- [ ] Support old and new device protocol versions
- [ ] Test against multiple iOS versions

### Security

- [ ] Safe storage of pair records (on disk/on memory)

### Performance

- [ ] Benchmark
- [ ] Reduce memory allocations as much as possible
- [ ] Optimize packet parsing/encoding/decoding
